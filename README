A simple bullseye trainer.

Required libraries:
  SDL
  SDL_TTF
  SDL_DRAW

Usage:
  When ran, at the upper left corner is displayed bandit's bullseye information.
  At the bottom left corner is displayed your own bullseye information.
  At the center of the screen is the bullseye graph which may help you at the beginning.

  Your "mission" is to rotate your aircraft towards the bandit using the information available.

  To turn your aircraft left use the left arrow key and to turn right use the right arrow key.
  When you think you got the right bearing, press space.

  When you press space following stuff gets drawn:
    - Your location and bearing (blue/cyan cross and arrow)
    - Bandit's location

  Using the new information, you see how close you got to the right bearing.

  That's it, press space to start over again with a new situation.
